# Results

## Color histogram and k-nearest-neighbor search

## Convolutional neural networks

The figure below shows training of a basic CNN with three convolutional layers
separated by max-pooling layers and terminated with a soft-max-loss layer over
75 epochs. We used four fifths of the component images, all resized to 32x32,
for the training set and the remaining fifth as the validation set.
